# text-capture

Simple text capture + translate PyQt app made with Qt designer, OpenCV and google API

Before you try it out, you need to install <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a> and point its direction in the main file, as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/">pytesseract</a> is simply its wrapper. 

As of 29-01-2021 googletrans Attribute error is not yet fixed - for the app to work you need to install the alpha version with:
